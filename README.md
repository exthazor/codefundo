Project: EmerAgency (Disaster Management)

Our project is aimed at marking certain locations “danger-prone”. We’ve implemented it through a website where an individual can mark his location safe or unsafe based on the natural conditions around him. Upon marking, the database would be updated accordingly. Other users living in the same location would be prompted with a notification, rather a warning, which will let them know of the imminent threat. 

There would also be an option to mark oneself – “safe” or “unsafe”. If someone marks himself unsafe, the request would directly go to the nearest government relief/help centre and he would receive help soon enough. This will greatly affect areas – especially the North-Eastern and Southern parts of the country owing to the imminent floods killing thousands of people and dislocating millions. 

We are well aware of the growing quantity of people who misuse the internet and misuse certain online platforms. For that, we’ll have numerous security protocols in place to protect our website from being hacked, exploited in a way which would harm those using it. 

Users around the globe are connected constantly due to the rapid development of 4G network in the country. Our project is just one out of the vast arrays of projects possible for the betterment of humanity using technology.
